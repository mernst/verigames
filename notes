Verigames deliverables for Nat and Steph:
  file formats
  data structures
  hand-translated boards
  a complete and comprehensible algorithm that someone can code

We'll need these algorithms:
 * for user code:
    * program -> unoptimized network
    * network -> optimized network
 * for libraries:
    * annotated library -> optimized network



Verigames:  with only 2 values, why can't we solve the constraints in
linear time?

The answer is that the constraints are not solvable, in general.

The player needs to find a set of constraints that satisfies the tests but
not necessarily the type system.
Or, the player needs to find the place that an exception (cast) is needed.

Gameplay needs to specify when you drop a ball for type-based simulation.
Usually, but not always...
