Each of these folders contains the three files describing a set of
levels. Some of these folders contain subfolders used for assembling
those files.


- setup/

  Contains the levels stored in individual files.  Use
  _combineLevels.py to combine them all into one set.


- incoming/

  Contains input files that are used to generate the levels.  Use
  _convertLevels.py to convert them into levels in the setup/ folder.
