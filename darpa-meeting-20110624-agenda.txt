Agenda for Drew Dean visit on Friday, June 24

(1-2 hours)
(Zoran can make any time except 1:30-2:30pm on Friday, June 24)


 * quick overview of programmatics (e.g., budget, subcontract)
 * game mechanics
    * mostly these will be familiar to you
    * some interesting ones, for instance to indicate that a specific key
      appears in a map (which means that a lookup on that key succeeds)
 * algorithm for translating a program into a game
    * examples of hand-translated programs
    * we have not yet started implementing the algorithm -- we are still
      refining it via manual application
 * argument (not yet a formal proof) that the completed game is a proof of
   correctness for the program
 * demo (I hope!) of a playable game
    * the layout (where on the screen each game component appears) will be
      entirely manual; we haven't automated this yet
    * no connection yet to real test cases, which we eventually plan to
      display as an animation in the context of the game board
 * discussion of collaborative/social/competitive aspects
 * Drew's needs for the August presentation to the director
 * more?
