Change null test node to something that does not refer to null, change white
ball to small ball, and change black ball to large ball.

Allow Graphviz to order the input and output ports by representing the incoming
and outgoing nodes as multiple nodes (one for each port).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add framework to lay out edges with Graphviz
   - Establish XML format for edge layout information
   - Make second pass with neato -n

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improve error handling in layout package -- make sure that internal errors are
sent to the client in a useful way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make certain edges straighter
   - Select the edges that form a path from a particular input port to a
     particular output port (fuzzy, write a heuristic to figure out which ones
     to straighten)
   - Set the weight of those edges to be higher (Graphviz will lay them out
     straighter)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement different contexts for Subnetworks (different pipes are visible
depending on where the subnetwork is)

For example, a subnetwork representing a method call in a different class will
not (generally) include all the fields of that class as input and output pipes

Add Map KeyFor data to Pipe Jam
