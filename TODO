See if edge width can be increased

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improve error handling in layout package -- make sure that internal errors are
sent to the client in a useful way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add a check that no edges are going up -- involves calculating the path of a
B-spline and/or pulling in a third party library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change the word "active" to something more descriptive, like
"underConstruction," and better document when "inactive" or "constructed"
objects are required.

new name for active? "mutable" "underConstruction"
deactivate would be "makeImmutable" "finishConstruction"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test NullTest setOutput for failure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write tests for the layout package

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compare generated XML against an oracle in tests

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update existing tests that used to need reflection, but don't anymore now that
they are in the same package as their test targets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change null test node to something that does not refer to null, change white
ball to small ball, and change black ball to large ball.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow Graphviz to order the input and output ports by representing the incoming
and outgoing nodes as multiple nodes (one for each port).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make certain edges straighter
   - Select the edges that form a path from a particular input port to a
     particular output port (fuzzy, write a heuristic to figure out which ones
     to straighten)
   - Set the weight of those edges to be higher (Graphviz will lay them out
     straighter)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement different contexts for Subnetworks (different pipes are visible
depending on where the subnetwork is)

For example, a subnetwork representing a method call in a different class will
not (generally) include all the fields of that class as input and output pipes

To do this, just allow empty ports -- come up with some mechanic so that safety
is still offered (maybe it must explicitly be set to null?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add Map KeyFor data to Pipe Jam
