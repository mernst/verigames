Also, each month submit a more formal monthly technical report specified by
CDRL A003.  That report should include sections for technical information
(detailed narrative of progress), deliverables submitted, publications
made, meetings, issues or concerns, and objectives for the next (monthly)
reporting period.  It should also include a financial summary chart.
Templates for this report (in .ppt OR .docx) appear in this directory.
