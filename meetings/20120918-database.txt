Notes for phone call with DARPA about database requirements


We do need to store data in a database, but our needs (in terms of
functionality, size, and performance) are modest enough that we expect that
any reasonable database will be adequate, and either SQL or NoSQL will be
fine.




Stored by the integrator:
 * Data about specific players, their performance on given levels, their
   skills and preferences, the
 * History of messages between players

Program analysis storage requirements:
 * Programs
 * For each program, multiple translations into games (for different
   security properties)
 * For each game, a set of solutions [is this stored by the integrator instead?]

Game storage requirements:
 * The flash game itself, which will be served to players
 * Logging of player actions (could be stored at UW instead)
