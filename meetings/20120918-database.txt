Notes for phone call with DARPA about database requirements


We do need to store data in a database, but our needs (in terms of
functionality, size, and performance) are modest enough that we expect that
any reasonable database will be adequate, and either SQL or NoSQL will be
fine.




Stored by the integrator:
 * Data about specific players, their performance on given levels, their
   skills and preferences, the
 * History of messages between players

Program analysis storage requirements:
 * Programs
 * For each program, multiple translations into games (for different
   security properties)
 * For each game, a set of solutions [is this stored by the integrator instead?]

Game storage requirements:
 * The flash game itself, which will be served to players
 * Logging of player actions (could be stored at UW instead)


Zoran says:
The key thing is that we have the ability to query in realtime the data of
last 2 levels, and at the same time get full history data at a slower pace
where time is not critical.  That often means two layers of the data, with
the first layer being soft of a buffer: limited memory most recent stuff
that can be read quickly.
