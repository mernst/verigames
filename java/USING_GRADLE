To use Gradle: At the moment you MUST have the checker-framework built from
source as described in:
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#build-source
You must have the JSR308 and CHECKERS environment variables set as described in
the manual.

You must also download plume-lib, documented here, and place it in your $JSR308
folder:
http://plume-lib.googlecode.com/hg/README.html

Download from: http://www.gradle.org/ Note:  I have a version with read/execute
permissions available at: /homes/gws/jburke/gradle/current The executable is
merely a script that runs a java jar so you should only have to download,
unzip, and add the bin directory to your path.

You must also check out and build checker-framework-inference source:
cd $JSR308
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/checker-framework-inference/
cd checker-framework-inference
gradle allJars

Please read the comments at the top of the build scripts for more information
on running them but a quick description appears below.  Gradle works much like
Ant with "Tasks" replacing "Targets" and Groovy replacing xml (plus a lot of
nice features like dependency resolution). Note:  The exact behavior of these
scripts will likely be tweaked in the future.  They currently do not support
tests.

NOTE:  You can always see the documentation of all tasks for a gradle project
by executing: gradle tasks

Checker Framework Inference gradle compileJava - Compiles BOTH scala and java
files in the src directory.

gradle jar - Creates a jar of ONLY checker-framework-inference code

gradle allJar - If you have the standard JSR308 layout (i.e. a jsr308 dir with
jsr308-langotols, annotation-file-utilities, checker-framework, and
checker-framework-inference source projects in it) and all but the inference
project are built then this will create a "fat jar" with all of the relevant
dependencies for checker-framework-inference except scala (since you run the
project through the scala command these are unnecessary).

gradle clean - removes all built files including jars


Verigames: There are 4 files related to gradle in verigames.  java/build.gradle
is the parent project that allows both java/Generation and java/Translation to
be built via gradle.

gradle compileJava - Compiles both scala and java files in the Generation and
Translation

gradle jar - Create a "fat jar" there is no "allJar" because Generation and
Translation can be used to create their own standalone jars individuall.  This
requires that you have already called the allJar task in
Checker-Framework-Inference although this requirement is likely to be relaxed
in the future.

gradle clean - removes built files including jars

gradle infer - Run an inference checker and generate a game world.

    -P will pass through a parameter to the Gradle project (NOT the JVM or 
    the task itself).  

    infChecker - indicates the checker to use (the trusted checker in this case)  
    This parameter currently supports the values "nullness" and "trusted".  To 
    add another checker you need only to add it to a map that is laid out in 
    the java/Generation/build.gradle script (it's usage will be obvious).

    infArgs - at this point is just a string that is appended to the invocation 
    of TTIRun (which launches the checker).  Currently you should put all the 
    files you want checked in this argument in the following manner: 
    "file1.java file2.java file3.java", the spaces and quotations are 
    necessary.  In the future it would be nice to change this to a sourcepath 
    argument or something more sophisticated but this will get you up and 
    running for now.

    debugInf - That will cause TTIRun to be executed with the variables:
    '-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005'
    This will let you hook a debugger to port 5005 in order to debug code 
    executed by verigames.  When I debug I generally use the following 
    command:
    
    gradle --daemon --stacktrace infer -P debugInf=true -P infChecker=trusted 
           -P infArgs="/Users/jburke/Documents/tmp/Test.java"

    Note:  gradle -daemon will save you a fair bit of time.  I don't use the 
    gradle --debug flag because that adds a bunch of gradle logging that we 
    generally don't want to see.

The build.gradle files in Generation and Translation also has similar tasks.
