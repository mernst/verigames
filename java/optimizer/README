                           Verigames XML Optimizer
                     -----------------------------------

Building
-------------

Follow the setup instructions in the "USING_GRADLE" file one level up. Then, in
this folder:

    gradle jar

This will generate the file build/libs/optimizer.jar which the start script
uses to run the project (below).


Running
-------------

Get help:

    ./optimizer.sh --help

Sample usage:

    ./optimizer.sh <../Translation/veritest/layout/GETLayoutTest.expected.xml


Hacking
-------------

All the source is written in Java, and it all lives in src/main/java (which is
the default expected source path for Gradle's Java plugin).
