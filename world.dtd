Layout information:

   X and Y coordinates are integers starting at 0. (0,0) is the top left
   corner.

   Width:

      - MERGE, SPLIT, and NULL_TEST nodes have a width of 2. That is, a node to
      the right of a MERGE at (0,0) must be at (2,0) or to the right.

      - SUBNETWORK nodes have width = max(#incoming edges, #outgoing edges)

      - END nodes have a width of 1

   Height:

      - MERGE, SPLIT, START_XXX_BALL, and SUBNETWORK nodes have a height of 2.
      That is, a node below a SPLIT at (0,0) must be at (0,2) or below.

      - Nodes connected by an edge with pinch=true must have an extra y
      coordinate between them.

      - END nodes have a height of 1

Requirements not enforced by the DTD:

   - All edges are contained in exactly one edge-set

   - All nodes that have kind SUBNETWORK must have a name attribute

Misc:

   - NULL_TEST node:

      - Represents the branching that occurs when the variable represented by
      the input edge is tested against null.

      - Upon encountering this node, a small ball will roll to the output edge
      at port 0, and a large ball will roll to the output edge at port 1.

      - The output edge at port 0 must be narrow, and the output edge at port 1
      must be wide.
